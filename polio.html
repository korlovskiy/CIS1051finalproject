        <p class="color">Most people who get infected with poliovirus will not have any visible symptoms.</p>
        <p class="color">About 1 in 4 people (or 25 out of 100) with poliovirus infection will have flu-like symptoms that can include:</p>


        <p class="color"> Sore throat
        </p>
    

        <p class="color"> Fever</p>
    

         <p class="color">Tiredness</p>
         <p class="color">Nausea</p>
         <p class="color">Headache </p>
         <p class="color">Stomach pain </p>

         <p class="color">A smaller proportion of people with poliovirus infection will develop other, more serious symptoms that affect the brain and spinal cord:</p>
         <p class="color">Meningitis (infection of the covering of the spinal cord and/or brain) occurs in about 1 in 5 out of 100 people with poliovirus infection, depending on virus type   </p>
         <p class="color">Paralysis or weakness in the arms, legs, or both occurs in about 1 out of 200 people to 1 in 2000 people, depending on virus type.

        <h2 class="title"> Additional Information: </h2>
        <p class="color"> Polio has been around since ancient times.
        </p>
        <p class="color"> If someone had polio as a child or young adult but had kept or recovered some or all movement of weakened arms or legs, even to the point of being athletic afterward, they can become weaker in late adulthood.
