        <p class="color" > Hello and welcome to the Philadelphia Vaccine Forecaster! Our website is designed for Philadelphia adults ages 19 and up to upload their official Philadelphia Immunization Record from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, and in turn get recommendations for which vaccinations they should receive or renew. Our recommendations are based on the CDC’s Adult Vaccination Immunization Schedule, which can be found <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html">here.</a>
            </p>

             
        



        <h2 class="title"> Important: </h2>
        <p class="color"> Please note, we are not a HIPAA compliant entity, and this website is not intended to provide medical advice. Our website seeks to provide a general framework for vaccination based on CDC guidelines. Please consult with your medical provider to determine the most accurate vaccine schedule for you. Additionally, your vaccination data will not be stored.
