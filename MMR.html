        <h2 class="title"> Ways that the virus is transmitted: </h2> 

        <h3 class="title"> Measles and Rubella: </h3> 
        <p class="color"> Spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The measles virus can stay in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person was there and is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people close to him or her will also become infected if they are not protected.

        </p>


        <h3 class="title"> Mumps: </h3> 
        <p class="color"> The virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is transmitted person to person through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets of a person infected with mumps.
        </p>
