        <h2 class="title"> About the virus: </h2> 


        <p class="color" > Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs.  It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death.

        <h2 class="title"> Ways to contract the virus: </h2> 


    <p class="color" > Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. A person might additionally get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.</p>
